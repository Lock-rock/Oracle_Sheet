Understanding SGA and PGA
SGA: The SGA is a shared memory area that contains data and control information for the Oracle database. It includes components like the database buffer cache, shared pool, and redo log buffer.
PGA: The PGA is a memory region that contains data and control information for a single Oracle process. It is used for operations such as sorting and joining.
General Guidelines for Configuration

Total Memory Allocation:
With 32 GB of RAM, you need to allocate memory for the operating system and other applications. A common practice is to leave about 20% of the total RAM for the OS and other processes.
This means you can allocate approximately 25.6 GB (80% of 32 GB) for Oracle.

SGA Configuration:
A common recommendation is to allocate about 60-70% of the total available memory to the SGA.
For example, if you allocate 25.6 GB to Oracle, you might set the SGA to around 15-18 GB.

PGA Configuration:
The remaining memory can be allocated to the PGA. A common practice is to allocate about 30-40% of the total memory to the PGA.
If you set the SGA to 18 GB, you could allocate around 7-10 GB to the PGA.
Example Configuration
Here’s how you might set the SGA and PGA in Oracle:

Set SGA: You can set the SGA parameters in the init.ora file or using the ALTER SYSTEM command. Here’s an example using the ALTER SYSTEM command:
ALTER SYSTEM SET SGA_TARGET = 16G SCOPE=BOTH;
ALTER SYSTEM SET SGA_MAX_SIZE = 18G SCOPE=SPFILE;

Set PGA: You can set the PGA parameters similarly:
ALTER SYSTEM SET PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET = 8G SCOPE=BOTH;
Example Initialization Parameters

Here’s a summary of the parameters you might set:
ALTER SYSTEM SET SGA_TARGET = 16G SCOPE=BOTH; -- Total SGA size
ALTER SYSTEM SET SGA_MAX_SIZE = 18G SCOPE=SPFILE; -- Maximum SGA size
ALTER SYSTEM SET PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET = 8G SCOPE=BOTH; -- Total PGA size
Additional Considerations

Monitoring: After setting these parameters, monitor the performance of your database using Oracle's performance views (like V$SGA, V$PGA_TARGET_ADVICE, and V$MEMORY_TARGET_ADVICE) to ensure that the settings are optimal.
Tuning: Depending on the workload, you may need to adjust these values. For example, if you have many concurrent users or heavy sorting operations, you might need to increase the PGA.
Automatic Memory Management (AMM): If you prefer, you can enable Automatic Memory Management (AMM) by setting MEMORY_TARGET and MEMORY_MAX_TARGET, which allows Oracle to manage SGA and PGA dynamically.
Conclusion
The exact values for SGA and PGA can vary based on your specific workload and usage patterns, so it’s essential to monitor and adjust as necessary. Always test changes in a development environment before applying them to production.
