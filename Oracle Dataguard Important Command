Query to apply redo log on standby. Following command useful for real time apply

ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE USING CURRENT LOGFILE; 
To Start the MRP process using archive log

alter database recover managed standby database disconnect from session;
To check applied archieve logs

SELECT SEQUENCE#, APPLIED FROM V$ARCHIVED_LOG;
Cancel the MRP Process

alter database recover managed standby database cancel;
Status of MRP Process

select process,status,client_process,thread#,sequence#,block#,blocks,delay_mins from v$managed_standby;
To get the difference between Received and applied logs.

select  MAX_RECEIVED,MAX_APPLIED,(MAX_RECEIVED - MAX_APPLIED) as "Difference" from (SELECT
    ARCHIVED_THREAD#, MAX(ARCHIVED_SEQ#) as MAX_RECEIVED,
    APPLIED_THREAD#,  MAX(APPLIED_SEQ#) as  MAX_APPLIED
 FROM
   V$ARCHIVE_DEST_STATUS) ARCH ; 
 

To check the status of Archive log

select THREAD#,SEQUENCE#,FIRST_TIME,NEXT_TIME,BLOCKS,BLOCK_SIZE,ARCHIVED,APPLIED,STATUS,IS_RECOVERY_DEST_FILE from v$ARCHIVED_LOG;


TO check if dataguard in synchronizing with standby.

select thread#,max(sequence#) from v$archived_log where applied='YES' group by thread#;

Check physical Standby is in sync Dataguard in Oracle
The following command will help to check the Standby is synced with Primary Database in Oracle Dataguard Environment.

On Primary Server:

Check the current log sequence on the Primary database:

select thread#, max(sequence#) "Last Primary Seq Generated" from v$archived_log val, v$database vdb where val.resetlogs_change# = vdb.resetlogs_change# group by thread# order by 1;

OR 

Archive log list;
Check both primary and secondary archive in single command:

SELECT b.last_seq prmy_last_file,
      a.applied_seq stdby_last_file ,TO_CHAR (a.latest_apply_time, 'dd/mm/yyyy hh24:mi:ss') stdby_latest_time
 FROM (SELECT   resetlogs_id, thread#, MAX (sequence#) applied_seq, MAX (next_time) latest_apply_time
           FROM v$archived_log
          WHERE applied = 'YES'
       GROUP BY resetlogs_id, thread#) a,
      (SELECT   resetlogs_id, thread#, MAX (sequence#) last_seq
           FROM v$archived_log
       GROUP BY resetlogs_id, thread#) b
WHERE a.thread# = b.thread#
ORDER BY a.thread#;

On Physical Standby Server:

Check the received log on the standby database

--Check received log on standby
select thread#, max(sequence#) "Last Standby Seq Received" from v$archived_log val, v$database vdb where val.resetlogs_change# = vdb.resetlogs_change# group by thread# order by 1;
Check the applied log on the Standby database:

--Check applied log on standby
select thread#, max(sequence#) "Last Standby Seq Applied" from v$archived_log val, v$database vdb where val.resetlogs_change# = vdb.resetlogs_change# and val.applied in ('YES','IN-MEMORY') group by thread# order by 1;

On Standby: Even we can check with the archive gap:

col thread# for a20
col low_sequence# for a20
col high_sequence# for a20
select * from v$archive_gap;
Get the list of archived applied:

select sequence#, first_time, next_time, applied from v$archived_log where applied='YES' order by sequence#;


How to check the archive log sequence apply status on Standby Side/how to check data guard sync status in oracle

SELECT ARCH.THREAD# "Thread", ARCH.SEQUENCE# "Last Sequence Received", APPL.SEQUENCE# "Last Sequence Applied", (ARCH.SEQUENCE# - APPL.SEQUENCE#) "Difference"
FROM
(SELECT THREAD# ,SEQUENCE# FROM V$ARCHIVED_LOG WHERE (THREAD#,FIRST_TIME ) IN (SELECT THREAD#,MAX(FIRST_TIME) FROM V$ARCHIVED_LOG GROUP BY THREAD#)) ARCH,
(SELECT THREAD# ,SEQUENCE# FROM V$LOG_HISTORY WHERE (THREAD#,FIRST_TIME ) IN (SELECT THREAD#,MAX(FIRST_TIME) FROM V$LOG_HISTORY GROUP BY THREAD#)) APPL
WHERE
ARCH.THREAD# = APPL.THREAD#
ORDER BY 1;
