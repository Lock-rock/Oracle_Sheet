Pre-Requisites
Before setting up Data Guard Broker, ensure that:

You have an Oracle Database environment configured with a primary and standby database.
Data Guard is already configured and running between the primary and standby databases.
Both the primary and standby databases are using Oracle Enterprise Edition.
Oracle Net Services is configured to allow connectivity between the primary and standby systems.

Step 1: Enable Force Logging and Archive Log Mode on Primary
First, ensure that the primary database is in archive log mode and force logging is enabled:

Log in to the primary database as SYSDBA:


sqlplus / as sysdba
Enable force logging:


ALTER DATABASE FORCE LOGGING;
Ensure the database is in ARCHIVELOG mode:


ARCHIVE LOG LIST;
If the database is not in archive log mode, put it in archive log mode:


SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
STARTUP MOUNT;
ALTER DATABASE ARCHIVELOG;
ALTER DATABASE OPEN;
Step 2: Configure the Primary and Standby Database Parameters
You need to configure several initialization parameters on both the primary and standby databases to enable Data Guard Broker.

On the Primary Database:
system set log_archive_config='dg_config=(suncdb,suncdb_s)' scope=both;
alter system set log_archive_dest_1= 'LOCATION=/u01/app/oracle/oradata/suncdb/arch VALID_FOR=(ALL_LOGFILES,ALL_ROLES) DB_UNIQUE_NAME=suncdb' scope=both;  ==> For PRIMARY DB Archive Location
alter system set log_archive_dest_2='SERVICE=suncdb_s LGWR ASYNC valid_for=(online_logfiles,primary_role) DB_UNIQUE_NAME=suncdb_s' scope=both;  ==> For STANDBY DB Archive Location
alter system set log_archive_dest_state_1='ENABLE' scope=both ;
alter system set log_archive_dest_state_2='ENABLE' scope=both ;
alter system set remote_login_passwordfile='EXCLUSIVE' scope=spfile;
alter system set fal_client='suncdb' scope=both;
alter system set fal_server='suncdb_s' scope=both;
alter system set standby_file_management= 'AUTO' scope=both;

alter system set db_file_name_convert='/oracle/dbguru/','/oracle/dbguru/','/u02/dbguru/','/u02/dbguru/' scope=spfile;
alter system set log_file_name_convert='/oracle/dbguru/redo/','/oracle/dbguru/redo/' scope=spfile;
Step 3: Set Up Static Listener Entries
Make sure that the static listener entries are present on both the primary and standby databases to handle the Data Guard Broker connections.

Open the listener.ora file on both primary and standby servers.

Add a static listener entry for the databases. Example:


(SID_DESC =
  (GLOBAL_DBNAME = primary_db_DGMGRL)
  (ORACLE_HOME = /u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0/dbhome_1)
  (SID_NAME = primary_db)
)
Restart the listener:


lsnrctl reload
Step 4: Create the Data Guard Configuration Using DGMGRL
Now that the initialization parameters are set, use the Data Guard Command-Line Interface (DGMGRL) to configure the Data Guard Broker.

Connect to the primary database using DGMGRL:


dgmgrl sys/password@primary_db
Create a Data Guard configuration:


CREATE CONFIGURATION 'DGConfig' AS
  PRIMARY DATABASE IS 'primary_db'
  CONNECT IDENTIFIER IS 'primary_db';
Add the standby database to the configuration:


ADD DATABASE 'standby_db' AS CONNECT IDENTIFIER IS 'standby_db';
Enable the configuration:


ENABLE CONFIGURATION;
Verify the Data Guard configuration:


SHOW CONFIGURATION;
Step 5: Verify the Data Guard Setup
You can verify that the Data Guard Broker is working properly by using DGMGRL commands.

Check the configuration status:


SHOW CONFIGURATION;
This command should return the status of both the primary and standby databases. If everything is correct, the status should be "SUCCESS".

Check the primary and standby database status:


SHOW DATABASE 'primary_db';
SHOW DATABASE 'standby_db';
The status of each database should show "SUCCESS" and "ONLINE" as the role.

Step 6: Switchover and Failover Using Data Guard Broker
After setting up Data Guard Broker, you can easily perform switchover and failover operations using the DGMGRL command-line utility.

Switchover
To perform a switchover from the primary to the standby database:

Connect to DGMGRL:


dgmgrl sys/password@primary_db
Issue the switchover command:


SWITCHOVER TO 'standby_db';
Verify the switchover status:


SHOW CONFIGURATION;
After the switchover, the former standby database becomes the primary database, and the former primary database becomes the standby.

Failover
To perform a failover to the standby database (in case of a primary database failure):

Connect to DGMGRL:


dgmgrl sys/password@standby_db
Issue the failover command:


FAILOVER TO 'standby_db';
Verify the failover status:


SHOW CONFIGURATION;
After the failover, the standby database takes over as the primary database.

Step 7: Monitoring and Managing Data Guard with Broker
Monitor the configuration:


SHOW CONFIGURATION VERBOSE;
This will give you detailed information about the Data Guard configuration.

Check log gaps:

You can check for log transport and apply lag between the primary and standby databases.


SHOW DATABASE 'standby_db' STATUSREPORT;
Disable or enable specific databases:

To disable a database:


DISABLE DATABASE 'standby_db';
To enable it again:


ENABLE DATABASE 'standby_db';
Remove a database from the configuration (e.g., for maintenance):


REMOVE DATABASE 'standby_db';
