Thu Jan 08 11:02:35 2016
Errors in file /u01/oracle/product/11.2.0/diag/rdbms/TEST/test/trace/TEST_mrp0_6436.trc:
ORA-01111: name for data file 129 is unknown - rename to correct file
ORA-01111: name for data file 129 is unknown - rename to correct file
ORA-01110: data file 129: '/u01/oracle/product/11.2.0/dms/UNNAMED00008'

Reason for ORA-01111
This Error ORA-01111 occurs if we add a Datafile OR Tablespace in PRIMARY Database and that could not be translated to the Standby Database due to these Reasons:

Standy_file_management is set to MANUAL
Primary & Physical Standby are having different file structures and DB_FILE_NAME_CONVERT is not set according to the Directory Structures in Primary and Standby
Insufficient Space or wrong Permissions on the Standby Database to create the Datafile
The Redo Log generated from Primary will have Information about the Tablespace / Datafile added however it could not be created successfully in Physical Standby Database due to the standby_file_management = MANUAL
or is not able to find the specified Folder due to a missing / incorrect Filename Conversion. The File Entry is added to Standby Controlfile as “UNNAMED0000n” in /dbs or /database folder depends on the Operating System and eventually the MRP terminates.

Solution of ORA-01111
Perform all mentioned Steps on the Standby Database:

Step 1: Ensure the standby_file_management = ‘MANUAL’

Ezoic
NOTE : For the parameter db_file_name_convert change if the Data Guard Broker is enabled then edit the Parameters using the Broker,

DGMGRL>edit database '<standby>' set property DbFileNameConvert='/u01','+DATA';
DGMGRL>edit database '<standby>' set property StandbyFileManagement=manual;
By default StandbyFileManagement is AUTO by broker.

Step 2: Identify the File which is “unnamedn”

SQL> select name from v$datafile;
NAME
---------------------------------------
+DATA/TEST/datafiles/SYSTEM.DBF
+DATA/TEST/datafiles/UNDO.DBF
+DATA/TEST/datafiles/SYSAUX.DBF
+DATA/TEST/datafiles/index1.DBF
/u01/oracle/product/11.2.0/dms/UNNAMED00008
Step 3: Rename/create the Datafile to the correct Filename

SQL> alter database create datafile '/u01/oracle/product/11.2.0/dms/UNNAMED00008' as '+DATA/TEST/datafiles/appstex.dbf';
or
SQL>alter database create datafile '/u01/oracle/product/11.2.0/dms/UNNAMED00008' as new;
Step 4: Verify the Filename is correct

SQL> select name from v$datafile;
NAME
-------------------------------------------------
+DATA/TEST/datafiles/SYSTEM.DBF
+DATA/TEST/datafiles/UNDO.DBF
+DATA/TEST/datafiles/SYSAUX.DBF
+DATA/TEST/datafiles/index1.DBF
+DATA/TEST/datafiles/appstex.dbf

Step 5: Change the STANDBY_FILE_MANAGEMENT to AUTO

SQL> ALTER SYSTEM SET STANDBY_FILE_MANAGEMENT=AUTO scope=both;

Step 6: Start the MRP (this is using Real Time Apply)

SQL> alter database recover managed standby database using current logfile disconnect;
 Database altered.
Step 7: Verify the MRP is running as expected

SQL> select process, status , sequence# from v$managed_standby;
PROCESS STATUS SEQUENCE#
--------- ------------ ----------
ARCH CLOSING 1014
ARCH CLOSING 1013
MRP0 APPLYING_LOG 1001
RFS IDLE 0
RFS IDLE 0
RFS IDLE 1015
Step 8:  Make sure you corrected the error which caused failure of creation of file.

We have to ensure the STANDBY_FILE_MANAGEMENT and DB_FILE_CONVERT parameter are correct
